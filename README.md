A short description of the project.

## Quickstart

This section should be short, briefly explaining how to use the library,
preferably with a minimal working example in a Haskell snippet like this:

```haskell
-- short code snippets showcasing how to use library
-- (minimal working example)
```

As an example, `unliftio` has some short examples that showcase easy to
understand usages of the library.

## Technical Introduction

(optional) You may go into surface-level detail here about the problems this
library addresses.

`unliftio` also does a good technical introduction to the problem that
`MonadUnliftIO` address.

## Comparison to other libraries

(optional) Talk about other, related libraries. For each library, clarify
whether they solve a different problem, or if they have deficiencies that
this library hopes to address.
